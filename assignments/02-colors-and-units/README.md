# Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## Colors and units
In this assigment you will work on expressing your self with colors and units. 

### CSS Colors
As defined by W3c, colors can be defined in several ways:

* Hexadecimal colors
* Hexadecimal colors with transparency
* RGB colors
* RGBA colors
* HSL colors
* HSLA colors
* Predefined/Cross-browser color names
* With the currentcolor keyword

### CSS Units
CSS properties such as padding, margin, height, font-size will accept different units like 2em, 3px etc..

* Absolute lengths
  * Not recommended for screen, as not everyone on the Internet has the same screen size, pixel density etc.
  * Recommended for: use cases with known sizes, like print.
  * Examples: cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters), in (inches), px (pixels), pt (points), pc (picas)
* Relative length
  * Specifies lengths relative to another length property, scales better.
  * Examples: em, rem, vw (1% of width of viewport), vh (1% of height of viewport), % (relative to parent),etc.
