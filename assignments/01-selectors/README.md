# Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## Selectors
In this assigment you will need to grasp the concept of selectors to change the look and feel of the HTML file. 

#### Assigment
1. Open up the HTML file in this folder
2. Use the appropriate selectors to make the chages defined below inside the CSS sheet.


## Changes to implement
* This assignment can be done without changing any HTML, so please try to do this inside sheet.css.
* Below the assignments are related resources, open them up before starting.

1. Something has happened to the upper nav menu. Please fix the typo near line 7 in the sheet.css (hint: related to background).
2. Now we want improvements for the "Related"-links.
   * Remove underline on all "Related"-links (selector: aside ul a).
   * Change the link color to something less boring than the standard blue from Windows 95 (selector: aside ul a).
   * Create a hover effect when mouse is over the related links - without affecting the main nav menu. (selector: aside ul a:hover).
3. Chuck Norris called, he wants some left margin on his footer.
   * Inside sheet.css find selector "footer section" and add a left-margin of 0.5em.
